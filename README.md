First feature branch

Some observations
 - In the future we might want to name branches after features instead of our names
 - I created my own /Resources folder to contain the CSV file - one file so far for this first commit
 - When we merge the branches back into main we are going to have more than one folder with CSV files - we will need to decide on what to do about that
