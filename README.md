## Some questions that we hope to further explore with the data:

### NFL Sports Betting Myth Busting
- does rain really effect the outcome of the total score? Do games where the weather == rain go under the point total at a significant rate that you could use that as justification to bet the under

- Is there such thing as "being due" for a win/loss? Do teams who have failed to cover the spread for a significant period (3/4 wks?) justifiy that bettors wager on them to do so at a certain point, and vic versa

- Is it really hard to beat a team 3 times? What about twice? Analysing divisional matchups

### Predictive Analysis
- Do certain stats translate better than others at predicting wins/losses? 
- - (cont. ^ ) Is team offensive EPA/play a better indicator of future seasons' success / win total than defensive EPA/play


### Potential Machine Learning Qs
- Can we effective model win probability at certain points in the game using Machine Learning / Linear Regression?

- Can NFL defenses use past data to effectively predict whether the offese will run/pass the ball in any given situation (down, dist, score differential, time, remaining)

### Additional Questions
- Can we use win probability at given points in the game to predict whether or not a game will go over / under a live total line? (this question may require finding live lines at certain points in the game, which may be undoable..) Example scenario: a team reaches a 75% win probability in the 2Q, do these games go over/under the live point total at a significant rate. 

- Identifying fraudulent teams comparing margin of victory with record
