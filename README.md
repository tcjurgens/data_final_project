##Some questions that we hope to further explore with the data:

### NFL Sports Betting Myth Busting
- does rain really effect the outcome of the total score? Do games where the weather == rain go under the point total at a significant rate that you could use that as justification to bet the under

- Is there such thing as "being due" for a win/loss? Do teams who have failed to cover the spread for a significant period (3/4 wks?) justifiy that bettors wager on them to do so at a certain point, and vic versa

### Predictive Analysis
- Do certain stats translate better than others at predicting wins/losses? 
- - (cont. ^ ) Is team offensive EPA/play a better indicator of future seasons' success / win total than defensive EPA/play


###
-Can we effective model win probability at certain points in the game using Machine Learning / Linear Regression?
