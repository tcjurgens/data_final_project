# data_final_project

## Segment 1

### Presentation
- Selected Topic: NFL Sports Betting -- Myth Busting, predictive analysis in the manipulation of stat lines, and the assessment of NFL data sets on weekly game outcomes
- Why did we select this topic? Each group member has, at the very least, a knowledge base and interest level in the football landscape. After preliminary research, the NFL is one of many professional sporting leagues that intimately tracks granular stat lines that could be leveraged for this final project's objective
- What kind of data will we be sourcing/using? We plan to utilize betting tables (over/unders), as well as game databases that have been tracked for several decades down to the exact yard gained/lost and other contributing factors (pass yards allowed vs. opponents, home team performance metrics, etc.) from each game ever recorded
- What do we hope to answer with out data? Do certain stats translate better than others at predicting wins/losses? Can we effectively model win probability at certain points in the season based on previously recorded stat lines by season, by team, and all pertinent data. We also want to factor in external drivers, such as weather on team outcomes, consistently producing matchups (teams that beat conference rivals on several occasions throughout the season), and gauging historic team-based stat lines on future successes.
